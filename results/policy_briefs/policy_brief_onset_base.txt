**Stage:** onset  
**Theoretical Model:** Base  
**Best AUC:** 0.7941  
**Key Predictors:** ['lnltotpop', 'lnlrgdpcap', 't_claim', 'groupsize', 'numb_rel_grps']

**Stage-Specific Findings:**  
Early mobilization patterns indicate that economic and demographic factors are critical predictors. Groups with larger populations and higher GDP per capita are more likely to mobilize, while mountainous terrain provides strategic advantages.

**Analysis Recommendations:**  
1. Focus on lnltotpop and lnlrgdpcap for policy interventions  
2. Consider nonlinear thresholds: Economic development levels and group size thresholds vary by region  
3. Priority regions: Focus on regions with high ethnic diversity and recent autonomy changes  

**Key Findings:**  
- The model identifies total population (lnltotpop) and GDP per capita (lnlrgdpcap) as the strongest predictors of conflict onset, suggesting that larger and economically stronger groups are more prone to mobilization.  
- Terrain and claims to territory (t_claim) also play significant roles, indicating strategic and grievance-based motivations for conflict.  
- The presence of multiple religious groups (numb_rel_grps) and the size of the group (groupsize) are also important, highlighting the role of social fragmentation and group capabilities in conflict dynamics.

**Policy Implications:**  
- **Economic and Population Management:** Implement policies aimed at equitable economic development and population management to reduce disparities that may lead to conflict.  
- **Regional Focus:** Target interventions in regions with high ethnic diversity and recent changes in autonomy, as these are more susceptible to conflict.  
- **Strategic and Grievance Addressal:** Address grievances related to territory and improve governance in strategically important areas to mitigate conflict risks.

**Monitoring Recommendations:**  
- **Data-Driven Monitoring:** Utilize the AI model parameters and feature importance to continuously monitor regions based on population, GDP, and ethnic diversity metrics.  
- **Threshold Analysis:** Develop regional thresholds for economic and demographic indicators to identify potential hotspots before conflict escalates.  
- **Continuous Model Tuning:** Regularly update the model with new data and refine AI parameters to improve prediction accuracy and adapt to changing dynamics.
