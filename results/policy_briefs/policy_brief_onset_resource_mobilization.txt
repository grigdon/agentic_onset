**Stage:** onset  
**Theoretical Model:** Resource Mobilization  
**Best AUC:** 0.8024  
**Key Predictors:** ['lnltotpop', 'lnlrgdpcap', 't_claim', 'groupsize', 'mounterr']

**Stage-Specific Findings:**  
Early mobilization patterns indicate that economic and demographic factors are crucial. Larger populations and higher GDP per capita correlate with increased likelihood of mobilization. Mountainous terrain also provides strategic advantages for groups.

**Analysis Recommendations:**  
1. Focus on lnltotpop and lnlrgdpcap for policy interventions.  
2. Consider nonlinear thresholds: Economic development levels and group size thresholds vary by region.  
3. Priority regions: Focus on regions with high ethnic diversity and recent autonomy changes.

**Key Findings:**  
- Economic resources and demographic factors (lnltotpop, lnlrgdpcap) are significant predictors of conflict onset.  
- Terrain features, particularly mountainous regions (mounterr), offer strategic mobilization benefits.  
- Larger group sizes (groupsize) are more capable of mobilizing, potentially leading to conflict.

**Policy Implications:**  
- **Economic and Demographic Management:** Enhance economic development and manage population growth strategically to mitigate conflict risks.  
- **Regional Focus:** Implement targeted policies in regions with significant ethnic diversity and recent political or territorial changes.  
- **Infrastructure Development:** Consider the strategic implications of terrain and infrastructure development to limit potential mobilization advantages in sensitive areas.

**Monitoring Recommendations:**  
- **Data-Driven Monitoring:** Utilize AI models with parameters optimized for conflict prediction (e.g., n_estimators: 1200, max_depth: 30) to continuously monitor changes in key predictors across regions.  
- **Threshold Analysis:** Regularly update and analyze thresholds for economic and group size indicators to anticipate potential conflict zones.  
- **Ethnic and Political Change Tracking:** Closely monitor regions with dynamic ethnic compositions or recent autonomy shifts for signs of early mobilization.
