**Stage:** onset  
**Theoretical Model:** Pom Rmm  
**Best AUC:** 0.7806  
**Key Predictors:** ['lnltotpop', 'lnlrgdpcap', 'lv2x_polyarchy', 't_claim', 'groupsize']

**Stage-Specific Findings:**  
Early mobilization patterns indicate that economic and demographic factors are crucial predictors of conflict. Larger populations and higher GDP per capita are associated with increased likelihood of mobilization. Additionally, mountainous terrain often provides strategic advantages that can influence conflict dynamics.

**Analysis Recommendations:**  
1. Focus on lnltotpop (log of total population) and lnlrgdpcap (log of GDP per capita) for targeted policy interventions.  
2. Consider nonlinear thresholds to better understand how economic development levels and group sizes impact conflict likelihood, which may vary significantly across different regions.  
3. Prioritize regions with high ethnic diversity and those experiencing recent changes in autonomy, as these are more prone to conflict.

**Key Findings:**  
- Economic strength (GDP per capita) and population size are significant predictors of early conflict mobilization.
- Political structures (measured by lv2x_polyarchy) and territorial claims (t_claim) also play important roles in conflict dynamics.
- The model identifies specific regions and conditions under which conflicts are more likely to arise, particularly focusing on ethnic diversity and recent political changes.

**Policy Implications:**  
- Implement economic policies that address disparities in GDP per capita to mitigate conflict risks in vulnerable regions.
- Population control measures and strategic urban planning should be considered to manage the risks associated with large population centers.
- Enhance political inclusivity and address grievances related to territorial claims to reduce the likelihood of conflict.

**Monitoring Recommendations:**  
- Establish continuous monitoring systems in regions identified as high risk based on the modelâ€™s predictions, particularly those with significant ethnic diversity and recent autonomy changes.
- Use the AI model parameters and feature importance rankings to refine monitoring tools, ensuring that they are sensitive to changes in key predictors like population size, GDP per capita, and political conditions.
- Regularly update the conflict prediction models with new data and adjust policies accordingly to preemptively address potential conflict triggers.

By following these recommendations, political officials can better anticipate and mitigate the risks of conflict, potentially leading to more stable and peaceful societies.
