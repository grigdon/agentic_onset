**Stage:** onset  
**Theoretical Model:** Base  
**Best AUC:** 0.7939  
**Key Predictors:** ['lnltotpop', 'lnlrgdpcap', 't_claim', 'groupsize', 'numb_rel_grps']

**Stage-Specific Findings:**  
Early mobilization patterns indicate that economic and demographic factors are crucial in predicting conflict onset. Specifically, larger populations and higher GDP per capita increase the likelihood of mobilization. Additionally, mountainous terrain can provide strategic advantages for groups, influencing their ability to mobilize effectively.

**Analysis Recommendations:**  
1. Focus on lnltotpop (log of total population) and lnlrgdpcap (log of GDP per capita) for targeted policy interventions.  
2. Consider nonlinear thresholds to better understand how economic development and group size impact conflict likelihood, which may vary significantly across different regions.  
3. Prioritize regions with high ethnic diversity and those experiencing recent changes in autonomy, as these are more prone to conflict.

**Key Findings:**  
- Economic strength (GDP per capita) and population size are significant predictors of conflict onset.  
- Geographic features like mountainous terrain also play a role in the likelihood of conflict due to their strategic advantages.  
- Regions with recent autonomy changes and high ethnic diversity are identified as high-risk areas.

**Policy Implications:**  
- Economic policies aimed at evening out income disparities might reduce the likelihood of conflict, especially in economically underdeveloped regions.  
- Population control and integration policies could be essential in regions with large and diverse populations to prevent conflict.  
- Special attention should be given to regions with recent autonomy changes, possibly through increased political engagement or autonomous governance support.

**Monitoring Recommendations:**  
- Implement continuous monitoring of economic and demographic indicators in identified high-risk regions using the key predictors (lnltotpop, lnlrgdpcap).  
- Develop an early warning system that incorporates both linear and nonlinear thresholds of economic and demographic indicators to predict potential conflict zones more accurately.  
- Regularly update and refine predictive models with new data and regional specificities to maintain the accuracy and relevance of the predictions.
