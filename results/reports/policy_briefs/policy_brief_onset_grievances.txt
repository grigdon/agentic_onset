**Stage:** onset  
**Theoretical Model:** Grievances  
**Best AUC:** 0.8239  
**Key Predictors:** ['lnltotpop', 'lnlrgdpcap', 't_claim', 'groupsize', 'numb_rel_grps']

**Stage-Specific Findings:**  
Early mobilization patterns indicate that economic and demographic factors are crucial predictors. Groups with larger populations and higher GDP per capita are more prone to mobilize, while mountainous terrain provides strategic advantages.

**Analysis Recommendations:**  
1. Focus on lnltotpop and lnlrgdpcap for policy interventions  
2. Consider nonlinear thresholds: Economic development levels and group size thresholds vary by region  
3. Priority regions: Focus on regions with high ethnic diversity and recent autonomy changes  

**Key Findings:**  
- The model identifies total population (lnltotpop) and GDP per capita (lnlrgdpcap) as the most influential predictors of conflict onset, highlighting the role of economic conditions and population size in conflict dynamics.
- Terrain and claims of territory (t_claim) also play significant roles, suggesting that geographic and political factors are also critical.
- The presence of multiple religious groups (numb_rel_grps) and the size of the largest group (groupsize) are important, indicating that social fragmentation and group mobilization capabilities are relevant to conflict risk.

**Policy Implications:**  
- Economic strengthening in vulnerable regions should be prioritized, especially focusing on improving GDP per capita as a preventive measure against conflict.
- Population management strategies, including education and employment opportunities, could mitigate the risks associated with large group sizes prone to mobilization.
- Policies aimed at promoting social cohesion and addressing grievances related to autonomy and political inclusion should be developed, particularly in ethnically diverse regions.

**Monitoring Recommendations:**  
- Implement continuous monitoring of economic indicators and demographic statistics in identified high-risk regions to detect significant changes that could precede conflict.
- Use the AI model's parameters and feature importance metrics to refine early warning systems, ensuring they are sensitive to the key predictors of conflict onset.
- Regularly update and recalibrate the predictive model to incorporate new data and adjust to changing conditions, maintaining the accuracy and relevance of the predictions.
