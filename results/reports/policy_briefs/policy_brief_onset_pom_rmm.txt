**Stage:** onset  
**Theoretical Model:** Pom Rmm  
**Best AUC:** 0.8135  
**Key Predictors:** ['lnltotpop', 'lnlrgdpcap', 'lv2x_polyarchy', 't_claim', 'groupsize']

**Stage-Specific Findings:**  
Early mobilization patterns indicate that economic and demographic factors are pivotal. Populations that are larger and have higher GDP per capita are more prone to mobilize. Additionally, mountainous terrains offer strategic benefits for mobilization.

**Analysis Recommendations:**  
1. Prioritize policy interventions focusing on lnltotpop and lnlrgdpcap.  
2. Account for nonlinear thresholds in economic development and group size, which vary regionally.  
3. Concentrate efforts on regions with significant ethnic diversity and recent changes in autonomy.

**Key Findings:**  
- The Pom Rmm model, with an AUC of 0.8135, identifies total population (lnltotpop) and GDP per capita (lnlrgdpcap) as critical predictors of conflict onset.  
- Political structures (lv2x_polyarchy) and territorial claims (t_claim) also play significant roles, alongside the size of the group involved (groupsize).  
- The AI model tuning improved predictive performance from an AUC of 0.7806 to 0.8135, highlighting the importance of optimized machine learning parameters.

**Policy Implications:**  
- **Economic and Demographic Focus:** Enhance economic development and manage population growth strategically to mitigate conflict risks.  
- **Political and Territorial Management:** Strengthen political inclusivity and address territorial claims through diplomatic channels to prevent escalations.  
- **Regional Prioritization:** Implement targeted policies in ethnically diverse regions and areas experiencing recent autonomy shifts to address specific grievances and reduce mobilization incentives.

**Monitoring Recommendations:**  
- **Data-Driven Monitoring:** Utilize the AI model's parameters and feature importance metrics to continuously monitor regions at risk, focusing on the top predictors.  
- **Threshold Analysis:** Regularly update and analyze the nonlinear thresholds for economic and group size indicators to adapt to changing regional dynamics.  
- **Early Warning Systems:** Develop and deploy early warning systems in priority regions, integrating economic, demographic, and political data to forecast potential conflicts.

By adhering to these recommendations, political officials can proactively manage and potentially mitigate the risks of conflict onset, leveraging both human and AI-driven insights to enhance decision-making processes.
